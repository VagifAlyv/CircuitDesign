This project consists of a series of Python scripts designed for simulating electrical circuits using the PySpice library. Each script corresponds to a different circuit setup, demonstrating various circuit configurations and their corresponding 
simulations. The project is intended for educational purposes, specifically for learning how to model, simulate, and analyze simple circuits using basic knowledge of differential equations, and Python's PySpice library.
